# Functions on cards 

Now, let's going deep about what are the functions we could do to those movie cards.

<strong>1)</strong> You could update the rating or comment to the current movie by clicking <b>update.</b>

Then, you will be in the same page as the one we enter our comment and rating for the first time. If you don't want to change the past comment or rating, just leave it blank!

Then, the comment/rating will not be changed when you click the done button, if you leave it empty :).

<strong>2)</strong> You could delete the current movie card by just clicking <b>delete.</b>
